# EasyShoP Project

### The website uses Spring Boot API project for backend server, with my SQL database for data storage.

⚙️

### Since my code changes are all in the API project, I needed to rely heavily on Postman to test my Application endpoints and logic.

However, a front-end website project is also avaliable in my starter code, so in that case I can test my work, and see how my API

is used on the web.
